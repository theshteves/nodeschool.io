/*---[USING MAP IN VIEWS]---(3/4)

Views are the primary tool used for querying and reporting on CouchDB documents.

Create a view for the database things-learn-couchdb which will just output all
the things which have the material metal.

The database was already created by this exercise in your CouchDB.

The database is located at http://localhost:5984/things-learn-couchdb
and an example document in this database looks like:

{
    "_id": "4a7bd4d6e47564639585459049000e15",
    "_rev": "1-eb84340e9061ff439f24e6ee56e5d8b1",
    "material": "metal",
    "name": "spoon"
}

The value in the view for each items that is made from metal
should be the whole document.

Example response for 1 element:

{ "total_rows": 1,
  "offset":0,
  "rows":[{
      "id": "4a7bd4d6e47564639585459049001d6b",
      "key": null,
      "value": {
	  "_id":"4a7bd4d6e47564639585459049001d6b",
	  "_rev": "1-1ca9e59b14f0a3fdc71e0cb401f8c6f7",
	  "name": "spoon",
	  "material": "metal"
      }
  }]
}

The _id for the design document should should be _design/thingsMadeOfMetal
and the name for the view should be thingsMadeOfMetal.

This will result in a view that can be queried at
http://localhost:5984/things-learn-couchdb/_design/thingsMadeOfMetal/_view/thingsMadeOfMetal

function(doc) {
    if(doc.material == "metal") {
	emit(doc.name);
    }
}
